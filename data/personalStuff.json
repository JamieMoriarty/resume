        "I'm 32 years old and I live in Valby with my spouse and our baby. I have a great love of learning new (programming) languages and frameworks, but I'm terrible at following through: In the past 2 years, I've enrolled in 21 courses on Udemy, started half of them and completed one. The lesson seems to be that unless I need it for work somehow, I don't really get it done. Having a family does not help I admit :)",
        "Besides family, work and endlessly enrolling in courses on Udemy... well there's nothing besides that because I don't have the time!"
